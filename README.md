# PacmanDQN
## Overview
### We have designed and trained a Deep Q Neural Network using Pytorch to play OpenAI Gymnasium's Atari Pacman environment.
### We aimed to explore the complexity of emergent behaviors by implementing and combining various AI techniques, such as convolutional neural networks, deep learning, and reinforcement learning.
## Requirements
### Python 3.11 specifically (3.12 will NOT work with the Atari environment for unknown reasons)
### All required packages are listed in the requirements.txt file
## How to Run
### Run main.py
### Do not uncomment the call to show_frame() at the end of main.py unless you wish to generate a PNG visualizing how we processed 4 frames worth of pixels.
